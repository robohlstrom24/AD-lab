# Active Directory Lab

(project in progress)

## Operational Relevance 

This project demonstrates foundational Active Directory (AD) skills modeled after an IT Operations environment. A Windows Server domain controller is deployed, and a custom organizational unit (OU) hierarchy separates users, groups, and endpoints. Identity and Access Management (IAM) principles are applied through role-based access control (RBAC) using security groups. Proficiency with tier 1 / tier 2 IT support tasks is demonstrated with screenshots.  

## Job Duties Demonstrated 

- Deploy and configure Windows Server Domain Controllers for centralized identity services
- Organize Active Directory using a custom organizational unit (OU) hierarchy to support lifecycle management and policy scoping
- Implement group-based access control using Active Directory security groups (RBAC)
- Configure and enforce Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to apply security baselines and role-based system controls
- Join and validate client workstations within domains to confirm authentication, GPO application, and DNS integration

## Future Enhancements

- Expand user lifecycle workflows to include bulk provisioning and role changes using scripted automation
- Introduce delegated administrative permissions within OUs to simulate tiered administration
